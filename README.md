# Flask_qgridworld
# Q-learning Algorithm Web Application

This is a web application that implements the Q-learning algorithm to solve the shortest path problem on a grid. Users can set the grid size, starting point, ending point, and obstacles, and the application will find the shortest path using Q-learning.

## Features

- Define a grid with custom size.
- Set the starting point, ending point, and obstacles on the grid.
- Run the Q-learning algorithm to find the shortest path.
- Display the shortest path on the grid.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/jiun264/Flask_qgridworld.git
   cd your-repo
